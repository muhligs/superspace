# superspace
The basic idea with superspace is that once the program is started, it starts to listen to key strokes and perform a task depending on those stokes. The whole point being two fold; to avoid taking your hands of the board and be free to assign any keystroke combination into a task without having to worry about accidental activation.

It is a small and simple program that works like this:

1) An activating key stroke sequence, space bar press while super key is pressed, activates a key stroke listener program.

2) The listener records every key until another space bar press.

3) The recorded keys are decoded and translated into a task which is performed.
